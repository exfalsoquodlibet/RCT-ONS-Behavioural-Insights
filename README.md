# Behavioural Insights for businesses: a Randomised Control Trial (RCT) at ONS

This project provides the R code for the a-priori sample size calculation and the random assignment to experimental conditions for the two-arm stratified Randomized Control Trial (RCT) (i.e., A/B testing in geeks terminology) that I designed and delivered at the UK Office for National Statisics (ONS) in 2018.

The project was the first application of behavioural science principles and RCTs to businesses at the ONS and successfully increased the number of businesses that returned the survey questionnaire by the specified deadline, thereby reducing resources spent response chasing.

The RCT was delivered while conducting the ONS Construction Survey in the months of April and May 2018. You could learn more about the successful inervention here: 5th International Workshop on Business Data Collection Methodology - Lisbon 2018 (https://www.ine.pt/scripts/bdcm/index.html) 

The project was a collaboration between myself (as Behavioural Insight Project Lead), the ONS Behavioural Science Unit and the ONS Businesses Data Operations Division.
