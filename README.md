# Behavioural Insights for businesses: a Randomised Control Trial (RCT) at ONS

This project provides the R code for the a-priori sample size calculation and random assignment for the two-arm stratified Randomized Control rial (RCT) that I led on at the UK Office for National Statisics (ONS) in 2018.

The project was the first application of behavioural science principles and RCTs to businesses at the ONS and successfully increased the number of businesses that returned the survey questionnaire by the specified deadline, thereby reducing resources spent response chasing.

We designed and delivered the RCT while conducting the ONS Construction Survey in the months of April and May 2018. For the businesses in the experimental group, we redesigned the material to include several behavioural ‘nudges’ to help them understand the purpose and expectation of the letters, build their trust that the ONS values their input and respects their effort, and create a positive engagement loop. Businesses in the control group received the business-as-usual survey material.

The project was a collaboration between myself (as Behavioural Insight Project Lead), the ONS Behavioural Science Unit and the ONS Businesses Data Operations Division.
